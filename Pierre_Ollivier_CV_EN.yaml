    experience:
      - company: Thales
        position: Embedded Software Engineer Apprentice
        start_date: 2025-09
        end_date: present
        location: France
        highlights:
          - "Refactored legacy C++ codebase to pure C, removing Libcamera/OpenCV dependencies to enable seamless cross-compilation and reduce build time (6m → 20s)."
          - "Shipped a custom stripped-down Linux kernel and drivers, slashing boot time (22s → 3s) and power consumption (450mA → 280mA)."
          - "Architected a zero-copy V4L2/DMA pipeline with hand-written NEON intrinsics, achieving soft real-time performance with minimal memory footprint (200MB → 6MB)."
          - "Engineered end-to-end MLOps pipeline for YOLO11: synthetic data generation, curriculum training, and TensorRT export for embedded inference."
      - company: French Army - 13th DBLE
        position: Soldier

    projects:
      - name: C11 Compiler in Zig
        date: 2025
        highlights:
          - "Developed a fully compliant C11 compiler from scratch in Zig."
          - "Robust enough to compile large-scale real-world projects like MySQL."
      - name: ZigCleaner (zc)
        date: 2025
        highlights:
          - "High-performance, multithreaded file system cleaner implemented in Zig."
          - "Capable of scanning 200,000+ directories in under 1 second using a custom work-stealing thread pool."
          - "Optimized for identifying and recursively removing large build artifacts to reclaim disk space."
      - name: Embedded Development on ATMega328p
        date: 2025
        highlights:
          - "Implemented low-level drivers for I2C, SPI, and UART protocols with direct register manipulation."
          - "Developed hardware interruption handlers and drivers for various sensors (temperature, display)."
      - name: Multithreaded Netcode
        date: 2024
        highlights:
          - "Implemented cutting-edge Lock-Step simulation and Thread-per-game architecture in Zig."
          - "Designed a custom binary serialization format minimizing client latency (< 1 ms)."
          - "Optimized memory footprint to under 512 Kb RAM."
